  <h1><i>The brave one</i></h1>
  <p> My name is Fernanda Moraes Oliveira, 27 years old, I'm from Brazil (as a lot of people here in Dublin). I love arts and art history since I was a little girl, I could name some artists and tell about their work, and Frida was always my favourite.<br> Frida represents a lot to me, and I own a lot to her. I'm looking to go to mMexico and visit her museum, and it would be my dream coming true.<br>
  I'm just starting in web development and I can say that I love it, somethimes I get angry that I can't run a code, but then I try again and check everthing, when I can fix it, I feel that I'm a superhero. I'm also looking foward to learn more about HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>I hope you can enjoy this website that I made with a lot of love!</p>
