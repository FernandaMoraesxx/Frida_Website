</i></h1>
<p>Frida was also deeply involved in politics, and this is reflected in the fact that she declared her birth year to be 1910, the year of the start of the Mexican Revolution even though she was actually three years old at that time.
Frida did not shy away from politics and joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948. This also led to a kind of transformation in her art, which now began to incorporate Mexican folk culture. She visited America and criticized the rich for celebrating their money while the poor suffered every day. So committed was she to her cause that even a few days before her death, her flailing health did not prevent her from participating in a protest against the CIA invasion of Guatemala.
Frida was a lifelong socialist and Marxist-Leninist. By the age of 16, she had joined the youth group of the Mexican Communist Party (PCM). In 1928, in her early 20s, Frida joined the PCM even though it had become outlawed (1925-1935).
Frida was an active organizer in the party. She wrote and gave speeches, attended meetings and led union rallies.
After being expelled in 1929 for politically supporting the Left Opposition within the Soviet Communist Party, Frida would rejoin the PCM in 1948. She campaigned for peace against the U.S.-initiated Cold War, which had begun with the nuclear incineration of Japanese civilians, and aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, the worldwide communist movement and all colonized peoples struggling for independence.
As a member of the party, Frida collected signatures for the Stockholm Appeal, a 1950 peace initiative anchored by the Soviet Union promoting nuclear disarmament and opposing the first-strike “nuclear diplomacy” of the United States. Some  273,470,566 signatures were gathered worldwide.
Even when diminishing health prevented Frida from full party participation, she remained devoted. She was lauded for her diligence in paying party dues on time and for her seriousness when it came to self-study. Frida contributed substantial financial resources to the party in certain areas, such as the Communist Youth.
