  <h2 align="center"> Work </h2>
 <p align="right">In 1953, Kahlo received her first solo exhibition in Mexico. While bedridden at the time, she didn't miss out on the exhibition’s opening. Arriving by ambulance, Kahlo spent the evening talking and celebrating with the event’s attendees from the comfort of a four-poster bed set up in the gallery just for her.

   <h2 align="center"> Personal life</h2>
 <p align="left">
    Kahlo, who suffered from polio as a child, nearly died in a bus accident as a teenager. She suffered multiple fractures of her spine, collarbone and ribs, a shattered pelvis, broken foot and a dislocated shoulder. She began to focus heavily on painting while recovering in a body cast. In her lifetime, she had 30 operations.

    <h2 align="center"> Feminist legacy</h2>
     <p align="right"> The legacy of Kahlo cannot be underestimated or exaggerated. Not only is it likely that every female artist making art since the 1950s will quote her as an influence, but it is not only artists and those who are interested in art that she inspires. Her art also supports people who suffer as result of accident, as result of miscarriage, and as result of failed marriage.

  <h2 align="center"> Pride of being a Mexican </h2>
     <p align="left"> Frida Kahlo was deeply patriotic, valuing and celebrating Mexican culture in a wide variety of ways throughout her life. She artfully wove her heritage through both her livelihood, painting several works that highlighted her national pride, and her everyday life, frequently dressing and engaging in traditional Mexican style.

 <br>
  <h2 align="center"> Her fight </h2>
     <p align="right">Frida was also deeply involved in politics, and this is reflected in the fact that she declared her birth year to be 1910, the year of the start of the Mexican Revolution even though she was actually three years old at that time.

  <h2 align="center"> About a fan </h2>
     <p align="left"> My name is Fernanda Moraes Oliveira, 27 years old, I'm from Brazil (as a lot of people here in Dublin). I love arts and art history since I was a little girl, I could name some artists and tell about their work, and Frida was always my favourite.<br> Frida represents a lot to me, and I own a lot to her.
