<p>Frida also dressed in a particular manner, very different from the Mexican women of that time whose attire consisted of pearls, suits, and hats. Frida’s fashion consisted of gay, Mexican tradition clothes – she adorned herself with clips, bows, ribbons, jewellery, scarves and costumes, and such dressing became an entrenched part of her identity. She sometimes also painted her dresses herself. Hence, she never bowed down to the required attire for “cultured” women in Mexico at that point of time. She challenged patriarchy in her own way. Some believe that she dressed in this particular manner to hide her deformities but her appreciation of herself through her paintings exhibits how much pride she took in her appearance.
Frida’s bodily trials also resulted in her inability to give birth. She went through the ordeal of multiple miscarriages. These experiences, she brought to life through her paintings. A piece she created after a miscarriage in Detroit is an example of this. The background shows a barren, empty sky, reflecting her internal state of sorrow and emptiness. She herself is painted as a naked body on a hospital bed. This body is not one that would belong to models in magazines or the “perfect” bodies that form the subject-matter of other forms of art. This body is painted as that of a woman who has undergone the agony of miscarriage. Her breasts are enlarged, she lies in a pool of blood and her abdomen is swollen. This has been interpreted and viewed as a stark and realistic portrayal of issues particular to women post puberty i.e. menstruation, miscarriage and abortion. This canvas mirrored her unique experience as a woman. She did not disassociate from the trauma that these specific instances afflict on women, instead she tackled them head-on and used her art as an outlet and as a mechanism to share experiences, which may be common to other women but are not talked about or given adequate importance to. And so, even as an artist, she was revolutionary.
The legacy of Kahlo cannot be underestimated or exaggerated. Not only is it likely that every female artist making art since the 1950s will quote her as an influence, but it is not only artists and those who are interested in art that she inspires. Her art also supports people who suffer as result of accident, as result of miscarriage, and as result of failed marriage. Through imagery, Kahlo articulated experiences so complex, making them more manageable and giving viewers hope that they can endure, recover, and start again.
