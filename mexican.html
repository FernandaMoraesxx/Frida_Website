<h1><i>"Feet, what do I need them for If I have wings to fly"</i></h1>
<p>Frida Kahlo was deeply patriotic, valuing and celebrating Mexican culture in a wide variety of ways throughout her life. She artfully wove her heritage through both her livelihood, painting several works that highlighted her national pride, and her everyday life, frequently dressing and engaging in traditional Mexican style.
Existing as she did as a mestiza in post-revolutionary Mexico, Kahlo’s art is frequently considered part and parcel of the mexicanidad movement, which is “usually described as a post-revolutionary intellectual and aesthetic movement that delineated Mexico’s ‘true’ heritage (its indigenous culture) from European and U.S. influences” (Lindauer). Frida Kahlo’s identity as a Mexican is evident in this way in some of her most famous works. Having spent periods of her life in both Mexico and U.S., some of her more culturally motivated projects involve visual comparisons between the United States and Mexican culture—in which Mexican culture is usually held up as being superior. 
She dressed as an indigenous Mexican would dress as an everyday elevation of the cultural identity she viewed as most purely “Mexican”.<br>Her Tehuana style also flew in the face of the European-imposed marianismo culture that dominated Mexico throughout Kahlo’s lifetime. While women were encouraged to dress subtly and modestly, the traditional Tehuana style was bright and light, showing more color and more skin than these Europeanized ideals would allow. <br>While marianismo is largely considered a Latin American cultural fixation, this Catholic emphasis stems back to the colonial period, during which zealots like Queen Isabella of Spain controlled much of Latin America.<br>For Kahlo, rejection of mariansimo was not merely a feminist statement, it was a cultural statement. <br>Photos of Kahlo in Tehuana dress with bright lipstick and flamboyant headpieces represent a deeply personal way in which she elevated the traditional cultures of Mexico above those of their colonizers.
ove of her home country and her devotion to its values even during her time in the U.S. It is clear from these images that, regardless of her time spent within other cultures, Kahlo’s “heart was always in Mexico” (Bakewell). In her appearance, Kahlo devoted herself to promoting indigenous Mexican culture. She sought to appear as traditionally Mexican as possible in an unprecedented overthrow of the colonial European values that had long choked Mexico and much of Latin America. Frida Kahlo is deeply precious to Mexican history and culture because Mexican history and culture were also precious to her. Her deep patriotism appeared again and again in both her life and work. Her contributions to the mexicanidad movement and her dedication to indigenous cultures helped to redefine what it meant to be a mestiza. Frida Kahlo was many things throughout her life—an artist, a wife, a feminist, a communist—but perhaps the most core element of her identity was found in her nationalism, and in the fact that she was deeply and proudly Mexican.
